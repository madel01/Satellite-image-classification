# Satellite-image-classification

This project focuses on classifying satellite images into four distinct categories: Water, Green Area, Desert, and Forest. To achieve this, I leveraged transfer learning techniques with fine-tuning across four state-of-the-art architectures: VGG, ResNet, Inception, and MobileNet. The models were evaluated based on key performance metrics, including accuracy, recall, and precision, to ensure robust and reliable results.
